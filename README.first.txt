Purpose:
********
This is a simple shiny app which presents a bar chart for
baby names from 1990 - 2013 in Alberta. 

The impetus for this type of project is that when parents are
considering names for their baby, they may want to see if the
name is:

	1) popular
	2) unique
	3) year by year trends


How to Use:
***********
The user selects the gender, enters a name and presses the
submit button to generate the graph.


Programmer Notes:
*****************
In order to demonstrate reactive expressions, switching genders
will re-read the data files. This is an exercise in learning
as opposed to efficiency and meets the goals of the assignment.


Possible Extensions:
********************
Allow the user to select from a top 25 list of names for that
year. 

Allow for other provinces or states. 


References:
***********
See babynamewizard.com to compare to a professional website.

See README.db.txt to understand how the publicly available data
from the Alberta government web pages is converted for use in R. 
It is not a trivial task given diacritics and data entry mistakes.

This project was created to fulfil the assignment requirement for
the "Developing Data Products" course at www.coursera.org.


cheers,
Robert
